#pragma mark - Countly CrashReporting
/*
 This SDK can be used for Countly CrashReporting service in addition to Countly Analytics.
 If the only thing you need is Countly Analytics, you can skip this section. 
 For Countly CrashReporting, you'll need to add one more line of Countly code to your application:
 
 For iOS, inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, just after the line you started Countly, add this line:
 `[[Countly sharedInstance] startCrashReporting];`
 
 With this one line of code, Countly iOS SDK will generate a crash report if your application crashes due to an exception, and send it to Countly Server for further inspection. If a crash report can not be delivered to server (i.e. no internet connection, unavailable server), the SDK stores the crash report locally in order to try again later.
 
 And you can use `CountlyCrashLog()` (just like `NSLog()`) to get custom logs with the crash reports. Logs generated by `CountlyCrashLog()` are stored in a non-persistent structure, and delivered to server only in case of a crash.
 
 A crash report includes following information in addition to Countly Analytics already provides:
 
 - Exception Name
 - Exception Description
 - Stack Trace
 - Used RAM
 - Total RAM
 - Used Disk
 - Total Disk
 - Battery Level 
 - Device Orientation
 - Connection Type
 - OpenGL ES Version
 - Jailbrake State
 - Background State
 - Time Since Launch
 - Custom Logs generated by `CountlyCrashLog()`
