# For your target, go to `Build Phases` tab and choose `New Run Script Phase` after clicking plus (+) button.
# Here the first line is a find command to find and extract the path to the script. If you know the path you can skip this line.
# Add these two lines:
#
# COUNTLY_DSYM_UPLOADER=$(find $SRCROOT -name "countly_dsym_uploader.sh" | head -n 1)
# sh "$COUNTLY_DSYM_UPLOADER" "https://YOUR_COUNTLY_SERVER" "YOUR_APP_KEY"
#
# or if you're using CocoaPods just add this one line:
#
# sh "$(PODS_ROOT)/Countly/countly_dsym_uploader.sh" "https://YOUR_COUNTLY_SERVER" "YOUR_APP_KEY"
#
# Notes:
# Do not forget to replace YOUR_COUNTLY_SERVER and YOUR_APP_KEY with real values.
# If your project setup and/or CI/CD flow requires a custom path for the generated dSYMs, you can specify it as third argument.
