# Countly iOS SDK

## What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile & [web analytics](http://count.ly/web-analytics), [rich push notifications](http://count.ly/push-notifications) and [crash reporting](http://count.ly/crash-reports) platform powering more than 2500 web sites and 14000 mobile applications as of 2017 Q3. It collects data from mobile phones, tablets, smart watches and other internet-connected devices, and visualizes this information to analyze application usage and end-user behavior.

There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and an SDK (mobile, web or desktop) that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

## About this SDK
This repository includes the Countly iOS SDK with watchOS, tvOS & macOS support. See [Countly iOS SDK documentation](http://resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/countly-sdk-for-ios-and-os-x)  for installation.

## Sample iOS Application
We also have a useful [sample iOS application](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sample-ios) which demonstrates how to use this SDK in depth. It includes iOS (Objective-C and Swift), watchOS, tvOS and macOS sample projects. Feel free to use them as a reference while you develop your application and also for easily testing your Countly server.
