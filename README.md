##What's Countly?

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, 
and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

This repository includes the SDK for iOS.

##Installing iOS SDK

Countly iOS SDK includes necessary tools to track your application. In order to integrate SDK to your application, follow these steps.

1. Download Countly iOS SDK.
2. Add these files to your project under Xcode: `Countly.h` `Countly.m` `Countly_OpenUDID.h` `Countly_OpenUDID.m` `CountlyDB.h` `CountlyDB.m` and `Countly.xcdatamodeld`
3. In the project navigator, select your project
4. Select your project
5. Select the **Build Phases** tab
6. Open **Link Binaries With Libraries** expander
7. Click the **+** button
8. Select CoreTelephony.framework, select **Optional** (instead of Required)
9. Select CoreData.framework
10. *(optional)* Drag and drop the added framework to the **Frameworks** group
11. In your application delegate, import `Countly.h`
and inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`  add the line;
`[[Countly sharedInstance] start:@"YOUR_APP_KEY" withHost:@"https://YOUR_API_HOST.com"];` at the beginning of the function.

**Note:** if you use Countly Cloud, you must set withHost parameter to https://cloud.count.ly for step 11.

**Note:** Make sure you use App Key (found under Management -> Applications) and not API Key. Entering API Key will not work. 

It should finally look like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
#import "Countly.h"  // newly added line
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
[[Countly sharedInstance] start:@"TYPE_HERE_YOUR_APP_KEY_GENERATED_IN_COUNTLY_ADMIN_DASHBOARD" withHost:@"http://TYPE_HERE_URL_WHERE_API_IS_HOSTED"]; // newly added line
// your code
}
</pre>

Note: If your project uses automatic reference counting (ARC), you should disable it for the sources `Countly_OpenUDID.m` and `Countly.m`:

1. Select your project
2. Select the **Build Phases** tab
3. Open **Compile Sources** tab
4. Double click `Countly.m`, `Countly_OpenUDID.m` and `CountlyDB.m` and add `-fno-objc-arc` flag

Note: Before upgrading to a new SDK, do not forget to remove the existing, older SDK from your project.
